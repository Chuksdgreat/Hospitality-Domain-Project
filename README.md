# Hospitality Domain Project 

## Introduction 
In this project, i used Power BI tool to bring clear insight 

## Problem Statement 
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. Data from all the hotels has been collected for study, analysis and business recommendation so as to help the AtliQ Grands recover or bounce back.

## Problem Statement 
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. Data from all the hotels has been collected for study, analysis and business recommendation so as to help the AtliQ Grands recover or bounce back. 

## Data 
Different data was collected carring different informations such as; data, hotel, rooms, booking and aggregation table. 

1. Date data shows us the different days, months, week number and day type of booking. With this we can see the level of booking the hotels receive on week days, weekends and for different months.

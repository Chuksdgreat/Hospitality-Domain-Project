# Hospitality Domain Project 

## Introduction 
his is a Power BI project on Hospitality Domain analysis from AtliQ Grand. The project is to analyze, draw insights and answer crucial questions so as to help AtliQ Grand improve their revenue.

## Problem Statement 
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. Data from all the hotels has been collected for study, analysis and business recommendation so as to help the AtliQ Grands recover or bounce back. 

## Skills/Concept demonstrated
The following Power BI features was incorperated;

1. Power query for data cleaning and transformation
2. DAX
3. Quick measures
4. Data visualization using different chart
5. Filter
6. Tooltip

## Data 
Different data was collected carring different informations such as; data, hotel, rooms, booking and aggregation table. 

1. Date data shows us the different days, months, week number and day type of booking. With this we can see the level of booking the hotels receive on week days, weekends and for different months.

## Data Modeling 
Because we have five different tables we are using to draw insights, there is need to establish relationship between these five tables so that our analysis and visualizatiion will be possible. 
I was able to also create twenty four new measures that reveals more informations from the date

## Data Visualization 

![](https://github.com/Chuksdgreat/Hospitality-Domain-Project/blob/main/Dashboard.png)

The dashboard has five different visualizations of data and five different filter that can be used for perusing through the date. Properly gleaning the necessary information from the dashboard will help to bring a concise and meaningful recommendation. 

### 1. Revenue category
   Here we can see the percentage of the revenue of business and luxury category of property.

### 2. Table of data

   The table contains various columns and new measures that will further give us more insight and information about the date. The data in this table can be arranged in ascending or    
   descending order base on the information we need to get from the data.

### 3. Trend

   The trend chart shows the weekly trend of revenue per room, average daily rating, and occupancy ratio

### 4. Realization and booking table

    Here we can see the booking trends and occupancy

### 5. Performance Table

   This table shows the occupancy, revenue per room and realization percentage of weekend and weekday performance.

### 6. Filters

   a. City: Help to filtter and peruse the data according to the difference cities where AtliQ Grand propperties are located.
   
   b. Room: We can glean lesson from different room type by using the room filter
   
   c. Property name: Help us access information of differently type of properties quicly.
   
   d. Month: The month filter give us access to view and study our data according to month.
   
   e. Week: The weekly filter help us to better peruse the data according to different weeks.  

### KPI(Key Performance Indicator)

The dashboard also carries the KPI of revenue generated, revenue generated per room, average daily rating, occupancy percentage, etc. The interesting of it is the fact that the KPI shows us the level of revenue that was generated according weeks and months. So as you select different weeks, the revenue and other performance key changes to the fiqure that AtliQ Grand is making for every week and months. 

## Conclusion, Observation and Recommendation 
1. The insights from the dashboard is hsowing that AtliQ Grand make more revenue from luxury property category than business property category. So i will recommedn that AtliQ Grand pay mmore attention to get more luxury properties and also check out the possible factor(s) why we have more people going for luxury than business.
2. Going through the dashboard, you will realize that there is a strong correlation between revenue and average rating. It means that the higher the rating, the more revenue AtliQ Grand is making. Since rating has to do with satusfying the customers need, i will recommend that AtaliQ Grand management increase their customer service so as to increase their revenue.
3. A concise run down of AtliQ Grand revenue and other activities according to different cities.

   a. Munbai: AtliQ Grand has eight properties in Mumbai with the highest revenue of 669 million, 3.9 occupancy % and average rating of 3.56. This means that because of the population 
      of number of properties Atliq Grand has in Mumbia, the revenue and occupancy tends to increase.
   
   ##### Observation for Mumbai:
   From the dashboard, i observe that Mumbai has the highest number of properties but the occupancy percentage and average rating of Mumbai is not consistent with the number of 
   properties that is located in Mumbai and this factor can be affecting the revenue that AtliQ Grand should be receving from Mumbai. In otherwords, Mumbai is expected to have the 
   highest number of occupancy and average rating because it has the highest number of properties.

   ##### Recommendation(s) for Mumbai
   I will recommend that the Mumbai management look into their services because that is possible what can be affecting rating and can also be the cause of low occupancy. If this is put     in in place, Mumbai occupancy will increase and te reneue will equally increase.
